                                                               Meus amigos


Annuindo ao convite para tomar parte do sarau litterario do dia 8 de maio,
recitei a poesia que vai lêr-se, e vós applaudindo-a indulgentemente,
desejastes possuil-a.

Publicando hoje essa modesta composição, satisfaço o vosso desejo e cumpro
um dever, prestando a minha singella homenagem ao Richelieu portuguez, ao
nosso maior vulto politico do seculo passado.

Guilherme d'Azevedo--o distincto e chorado escriptor, esse astro de
primeira grandeza ha pouco eclypsado no ceu da nossa litteratura, disse do
Epico:

«A verdadeira homenagem a Camões ou se paga com uma epopeia ou com um ponto
de admiração!

«Julgo preferivel que o meu humilde nome subscreva antes esta segunda prova
de respeito. Terá feito uma obra mais duradoura, e, sobretudo, muito mais
incontestavel!»

Eu, plagiando aquella phrase tão conceituosa, direi o mesmo de Pombal. Um
ponto de admiração seria uma homenagem mais duradoura e incontestavel do
que esse punhado de alexandrinos, que, ousadamente, vou sugeitar ao bisturi
da critica.

Que ella leve ao menos em conta a humildade do meu nome, que ha pouco tempo
ainda firma, nas columnas ignoradas de jornaes de provincia e nas paginas
dos almanachs, umas quadras massudas de um lyrismo piégas.

Valença--Maio--1882.

                                                                   _A. M._




I

De joelhos heroes! Baixai a fronte altiva,
Que passa triumphante, aureolada e viva
A sombra d'outro heroe!--a luzitana gloria
Que ha um seculo morreu para viver na Historia.

É cedo inda talvez para a consagração;
Não 'stão extintas já as luctas da paixão;
E a treva--a emulação--debate-se na liça,
Emquanto não raiar o dia da Justiça.

Mas vós, a mocidade, a esperança do Futuro,
Que altivos caminhaes, com passo bem seguro,
Na senda gloriosa e ardua do Progresso;
Vós, que haveis de lançar ao solo do Universo
A semente feraz da grande Idèa-Nova,
Deveis ajoelhar perante aquella cóva,
Que encobre veneranda a ossada do gigante
Que ha um seculo cahiu em lucta triumphante.

Ide!... ide ensinar ás gerações vindouras
Que ha paginas de luz que são immorredouras
Na historia das Nações!
                        Dizei a vossos filhos,
Que estão calcados já os gloriosos trilhos
Que hão-de conduzir ao fundo de seu peito
A força da Justiça e a força do Direito!


II

A noite tenebrosa, a noite dos horrores,
Estendia feroz as suas negras cores
Sobre a Europa abatida e sobre a terra inteira;
Apenas o clarão sinistro da fogueira
Illuminava a custo aquella triste scena;
Sentia-se um rumor como o rugir da hyena,
Havia um cheiro forte e acre e nauseabundo
Subindo em espiraes pelo azul profundo;
A carne a crepitar!.. Os gritos lancinantes!..
Como orgia infernal de velhos Corybantes!

Uma sombra indecisa, impavida e soturna
Fluctuava ali á viração nocturna;
Era a sombra do Mal--o negro pavilhão
Que tinha escripto em sangue um lemma: Religião!
E sobre cada corpo, e sobre esses destroços.
Conjuncto informe e nú de carnes e de ossos,
Andavam a pairar abutres esfaimados,
Despedaçando ainda os membros trucidados!

Humildes, evocavam o nome de Jesus,
--O nome da Justiça, o explendor, a Luz;
Traziam n'uma mão um velho Breviario;
A outra segurava o facho incendiario,
Um Christo sobre o peito, aos hombros uma estola...

Era a turba feroz dos filhos de Loyolla.

Portugal acordou, emfim, do seu lethargo;
Esgotára de todo o calix mais amargo.

Um homem, um gigante, um genio portentoso
Erguera-se de pé, n'um brado poderoso,
E disse sem temor áquellas turbas vis.

«Hyenas! recolhei ao fundo dos covis!
Largai a vossa presa, oh tigres sanguinarios!
De joelhos, chacaes! malditos salafrarios!
Hei-de lavar com sangue o sangue da Innocencia,
Matar-vos como cães, matar-vos sem clemencia,
E arrojar, porfim, ás fauces do abysmo,
Os vossos corpos nús e o vosso Fanatismo...

«A verdadeira Fé succede à Hypocrisia;
A Noite terminou, reaparece o Dia!»

E o braço poderoso e forte de Pombal
Arrebatou da treva o velho Portugal,
Para lançar a Luz, para lançar a Gloria,
Sobre elle, que era só recordação na Historia.

Exhausto e abatido ao sopro da desgraça,
Vergado ao Fanatismo--esse tufão que passa
E tenta destruir os brilhos da Rasão--
Sentia emmurchecer na sua heroica mão
Os louros que colhêra ao sol de cem batalhas.
Calára-se o canhão; o fumo das metralhas
Ja não tostava a tez aos bravos defensores
De Diu e de Malaca!
                    Esses conquistadores
Que tinham offuscado o nome de Veneza,
Que tinham concebido a audaciosa empresa,
--Na febre do valor, febre de triumphar,--
De avassalar a terra e submetter o mar;
Esse povo de heroes, titanico, indomavel,
Que dera ao mundo leis e fôra inconquistavel,
Já não queria colher da Heroicidade a palma.

Elle cuidava só... na salvação da Alma!


III

As gloriosas naus, as naus conquistadoras,
Que levavam no tópe as quinas vencedoras,
Traficavam agora o oiro, os diamantes,
O topazio, o rubi, os limpidos brilhantes,
Que outr'ora o Oriente e hoje o Novo-Mundo
Lançavam sem cessar do seu ventre fecundo!

E todo esse thesouro, e toda essa riqueza,
Era p'ra abastecer a perdularia meza
D'essa turba fradesca--a turba de vadios,
Que não passavam fome e não passavam frios,
Emquanto cá por fóra os tristes proletarios,
Famintos, rotos, nús, sem pão e sem salarios,
Iam implorar ás portas dos conventos
As migalhas servis dos fartos alimentos!

Um rei fraco, imbecil, um rei dissipador,
Assim, à imitação do Rei--Inquisidor,
Lançava essa riqueza aos tigres de roupeta,
Que tinham branca a face e a Consciencia preta.

Em vez de edificar escholas e hospitaes,
Surgiam contrucções athleticas, brutaes,
Que erguiam ao Azul, ao seio do Infinito,
As torres collossaes, gigantes de granito.


IV

Pombal surgiu, emfim, e encetou a lucta,
Heroica, gigantesca, audaz e resoluta,
Que havia de firmar a nossa autonomia,
E á Europa mostrar que era chegado o dia
Em que, aniquillada a negra Reacção,
O velho Portugal tornava a ser Nação.

A Industria floresceu e a Arte resurgiu;
O commercio acordou; de novo se cobriu
A vastidão do mar do nosso pavilhão,
Que ia transplantar a Civilisação
E levar aos confins de todo esse Universo
O nome Portuguez, extincto e submerso!

Depois, deixando assim firmado com ardencia
O acrisolado amor da nossa independencia,
Esse homem genial, espirito gigante,
Lançou o seu olhar ainda mais distante:
Reformou a Instrucção--o foco da Verdade
Que póde approximar o Genio á Divindade.

Um dia--horrivel dia!--um rude cataclysmo
Lançou uma cidade ao seio do abysmo.
D'essa terra gentil, que se chamou Lisboa,
Só restava um montão que fuma e se esborôa!..

Pouco tempo depois erguia-se imponente
A nova capital, mais bella e mais ridente...

Calêmos-nos agora!.. Ha-de-se admirar!..
Porque a nossa razão não sabe explicar
Gomo é que um braço sò podesse, sem canceira,
Alevantar do pó uma cidade inteira!


V

Injusta muita vez, a Critica, ingloria,
Quer negar-lhe um logar no pantheon da Historia,
Chamando-lhe cruel, carrasco de mil vidas,
A elle, que remiu as raças opprimidas,
Que deu à escravidão a carta de alforria,
Apontando ao Porvir da Liberdade o dia!

E se elle teve, emfim, manchas ensanguentadas,
Tambem o sol as tem, que ficam offuscadas,
Pela irradiação da sua luz brilhante...

Está limpo o pedestal da estatua do gigante!
Elle foi da Justiça o braço vingador,
Como depois na França os homens do Terror.

Saudai-o Mocidade! Um brado bem seguro,
Apostolos da Luz, videntes do Futuro!
Vós, que saudastes já o genio de Camões,
Erguei-lhe um monumento em vossos corações.
É justo que façais dupla consagração:
--Ao genio da Epopeia e ao genio da Instrucção!

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
